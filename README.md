# What is Huber üì¶

**Huber** is a single development entry to simplify `GitHub release` package management with a live awesome list of GitHub projects.

- Manages released artifacts from github, and decide which version as the current to use
- Manages the default package repository with an awesome package list including popular star github projects (ex: K8s, K3s, cloud-native, etc)
- Supports `huber.yaml` in any public/private github repo aware to Huber to manage the described packages
- Supports secure protocols (`SSH`/`HTTPS`) for github communication
- Supports cross platforms

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
For Linux/MacOS users, please install necessary dependent libraries to make sure huber work as expected. Please run `make set-dev` or `hack/setup-dev.sh` to setup the environment or use any appropriate OS package manager to install the dependencies.

### Linux
```console
# Ubuntu
‚ùØ apt install libssl-dev libarchive-dev

# openSUSE
‚ùØ zypper install libopenssl-devel libarchive-devel

# CentOS
‚ùØ dnf install openssl-devel libarchive-devel
```

### MacOS
```console
‚ùØ brew install libarchive
‚ùØ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/libarchive/lib/pkgconfig
‚ùØ brew install openssl
```

## Installing Huber

### Installing the official version

For official releases, please install the latest release as below command. After the installation, `huber` path will be automatically added to the environment path by updating the`$HOME/.bashrc`. 
But, if it does not work as expected, please remember to add `$HOME/.huber/bin` in the environment path, so `huber` will be looked up correctly. 

```console
‚ùØ curl -sfSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/innobead/huber/master/hack/install.sh | bash

# Update the environment path if required
‚ùØ echo "export PATH=\$HOME/.huber/bin:\$PATH" > ~/.bashrc
```

### Installing the development version

For development purpose, please make sure go 1.14 installed, then build and install `kubefire` in the `GOBIN` path.

```console
# Setup development environment
‚ùØ make set-dev

# Install huber in $HOME/.cargo/bin, $HOME/.huber/bin and update ~/.bashrc
‚ùØ make install
```
